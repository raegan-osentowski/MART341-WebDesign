            The base to the Greek language is the alphabet. This alphabet is complex and is composed of many unfamilar symbols. There is 24 letters from alpha to omega. This alphabet was first developed in the 8th century BC, but as been changed and adapted since to the alphabet used today. The modern greek language has much resemeblence to the ancient greek language, but has been simplified significantly for easier learning and use. The alphabet comes from a variation of latin. This makes some of the sounds more familar for native english speakers. The alphabet contains upper and lower case forms, with varying symbols to represent them. The alphabet is seen in science and math world-wide making many of the letters familar for those learning the language.

            Greek is simple to learn with the right learning tools. First, pick up a text book on how to learn greek. The best books are ones that are interactive with writing and reading features. Additonally, finding a YouTube channel that speaks greek is benifical in learning to correctly pronounce the words. Pronouncation is the most difficult part of greek, as science and math courses do not teach the accurate pronoucations with the letters. Listening to music or TV shows in greek will help you recognize words and sounds better. Finally, if possible, find someone to speak with in greek. The best way to practice is to use what you have learned. Go to a cafe and order in greek or introduce yourself to someone in greek.
